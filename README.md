- The "Money Tracker App" is a web application that allows users to manage their finances by recording income and expenses. 
- Users input data through a form, which includes category (income or expense), amount, description, and date.
- This data is sent to a Node.js server using Express and stored in a MongoDB database. The application displays all entries in a table and calculates the 
  remaining balance by subtracting total expenses from total income, showing the result at the bottom of the table.
- Users can also delete entries as needed, making it easy to keep track of their financial status.
